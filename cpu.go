	// Chip-8 language is capable of accessing up to 4KB (4,096 bytes) of RAM,
	// from location 0x000 (0) to 0xFFF
	// Most Chip-8 programs start at location 0x200 (512)
	// and 16 general-purpose 8-bit registers named V0 to VF
	Memory [4096]uint8

	// The Chip 8 has 35 opcodes which are all two bytes long.
	Opcodes [35]uint16

	// V is 16 general purpose 8-bit registers, usually referred to as Vx, where x is a hexadecimal digit (0 through F)
	V [16]uint8

	// I is 16-bit registers. This register is generally used to store memory addresses
	I uint16

	//  ProgramCounter (PC) should be 16-bit, and is used to store the currently executing address.
	PC uint16

	// The stack pointer (SP) can be 8-bit, it is used to point to the topmost level of the stack.
	SP uint8

	// When these registers (delay_timer (DT) and sound_timer (ST)) are non-zero,
	// they are automatically decremented at a rate of 60Hz.
	// The systemâ€™s buzzer sounds whenever the sound timer reaches zero.
	DT uint8
	ST uint8

	// Graphics:
	// The graphics of the Chip 8 are black and white and the screen has a total of 2048 pixels (64 x 32).
	Display [64][32]uint8

	// The computers which originally used the Chip-8 Language had a 16-key hexadecimal keypad
	Keypad [16]uint8

	// The stack is an array of 16 16-bit values,
	// used to store the address that the interpreter shoud return to when finished with a subroutine.
	Stack [16]uint16
